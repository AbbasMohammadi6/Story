If we have files where we keep paswords or we had useless files that we didn't want to upload to the GitHub we could make them to be ignored.
first we have to make a secret file using this command (touch .gitignore).
and becaues it is hidden we can not see it using the command (ls) and we have to use (ls -a).
and we must open that file (start notepadd++ .gitignore)
Inside that file you should the name of the files that you want to be ignored.
(if we want to remove everything from the staging area we should use this command (git rm --cached -r . ))
in .gitignore you can use # to comment and use for example (*.txt) and all of the files with txt format should be ignored. 
if you add all of the file using (git add .) and than see the files in staging area using (git status) you will see that the files that we typed thier names in the .gitignore are not added to staging area.
